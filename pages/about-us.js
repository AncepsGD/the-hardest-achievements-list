            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <section>
              <h4>Geometry Dash</h4>
              <p>
                Only achievements within the levels of the official Geometry Dash series are eligible. Submissions from platformer levels, other metrics (e.g., creator points, in-game achievements, stars), or other games will not be accepted.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h4>Baseline</h4>
              <p>
                To be included in the main list, an achievement must be more difficult than the lowest-ranked current entry.
              </p>
              <h4>One Thousand Achievements Limit</h4>
              <p>
                If the baseline rank approaches or reaches 1000, a new baseline will be reassessed &amp; established, and any achievements falling below this updated threshold will be moved to the Legacy List.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h4><b>External Factors</b></h4>
              <p>
                <b>Achievements that rely on artificially increased difficulty through external limitations are <u>not eligible</u>.</b>
                <br />
                This includes (but is not limited to):
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Using a low-polling-rate mouse</li>
                <li>Playing blindfolded or with the monitor turned off</li>
                <li>Impaired setup</li>
              </ul>
              <div>
                <b>Exception:</b> Low-hertz achievements performed on mobile devices are exempt from this rule due to the inherent input latency of touchscreen controls. These achievements are recognized separately and marked with a dedicated <b>mobile</b> tag.
              </div>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h4><b>Consistency</b></h4>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Significant Difficulty Increase</b>
                  <p>A consistency achievement must represent a clear and substantial increase in difficulty compared to the standard execution of the level. (e.g., 75% then 100%, 150%, 70 spots above, exceptions are obviously made if it's unbalanced.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>One Achievement Per Level</b>
                  <p>Only one consistency achievement may be active per level at any given time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Achievement Replacement</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If a new consistency achievement is validated as more difficult than the current one, it will <b>replace</b> the existing achievement.</li>
                    <li>Submissions that are less difficult than the current achievement will <b>not be accepted</b>.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Allowed Actions</b>
                  <p>The following actions are permitted during attempts, provided they aren’t meaningful attempts:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Re-entering the level</li>
                    <li>Restarting</li>
                    <li>Switching start positions</li>
                    <li>Filler deaths (e.g., No clicking, random clicking)</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Performance Threshold</b>
                  <p>All attempts must demonstrate performance closely comparable in difficulty to the highest-performing run.</p>
                  <p>Examples of unacceptable attempts include <b>wildly inconsistent performances</b> (e.g., 215%, 8%, 100%), as they do not reflect true consistency. In such cases, only the highest-performing run (e.g., 215%) will be considered.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Moderation & Discretion</b>
                  <p>In cases of ambiguity, borderline performance, or disputed claims, a dedicated moderation team will review and evaluate the submission.</p>
                </li>
